# Overview
- We are building a tools to help AI or Data Engineer manage their pipelines, metrics efficiently.
- Engineers can use our python library to send logs and data to Kafka and kafka-consumer will process the event, save to database and display to user dashboard.
- Phases in a deployed AI project include: Input data, pre-processing data, AI Model, Build, Run. For the AI Model phase include train, test, etc we have MLflow, WnB. However, for other phases there's limited number of tools, we will aims to that.

# Target Users & Scale
- **Primary Users**: AI Engineers and Data Engineers
- **Expected Scale**: 100-1000 users
- **Deployment Model**: SaaS platform, open source and free for all users
- **Multi-tenancy**: Supported for organizations/teams with isolated data

# Use Cases

## Examples

- Netflix has a recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history. They want to automatically collect the data of user click to their suggestions to calculate model's performance in runtime. So they can use our python library to detect each time the model get calls and send the data to Kafka for processing.
- Data scientists import data from a data lake and may miss or have some invalidate data, they can use our python lib to track the error rate.

## Use Case Specifications

1. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Engineers integrate Python library to automatically log model calls, track prediction accuracy, and monitor system performance in real-time production environments.

2. **Data Quality Tracking**: Data scientists use the library to monitor data pipeline health, track error rates, missing records, and data anomalies during data processing workflows.

3. **Apache Spark Job Monitoring**: Monitor both batch and streaming Spark applications for performance metrics, job success rates, and resource utilization.

4. **Real-time Pipeline Observability**: Get visibility into AI pipeline phases (input data, pre-processing, model inference, post-processing) with automated logging and dashboard visualization.
